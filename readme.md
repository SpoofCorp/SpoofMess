# SpoofMess

## What is it?
A cross-platform messenger with any type of chats, stickers/emoji - that's just a dream for now.

## Quick Start
1. Install required software:
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Clone this project to your pc:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-folder>
    ```
3. Open cmd/powershell/terminal in root project
4. Write 
    ```bash

    ```
5. You can use swagger for next api:
    - [Spoof Entrance Service](https://localhost:7217/swagger/index.html)
    - [Spoof File Service](https://localhost:7138/swagger/index.html)
    - [Spoof Message Service](https://localhost:7146/swagger/index.html)

### Core Features
Now you can registration and authorize in app, also create you're chat, add members to chat, connect to other user chats and send messages to your chats.

### Roadmap
